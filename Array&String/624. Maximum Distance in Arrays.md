# Description (Medium)
You are given m arrays, where each array is sorted in ascending order.

You can pick up two integers from two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. We define the distance between two integers a and b to be their absolute difference |a - b|.

Return the maximum distance.

 

Example 1:

Input: arrays = [[1,2,3],[4,5],[1,2,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One way to reach the maximum distance 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array and pick 5 in the second array.
Example 2:

Input: arrays = [[1],[1]]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

m == arrays.length
2 <= m <= 105
1 <= arrays[i].length <= 500
-104 <= arrays[i][j] <= 104
arrays[i] is sorted in ascending order.
There will be at most 105 integers in all the arrays.

# thoughts
the naive way to solve this is to sort the whole array. But we can do better than that. 
Brute force is not working.

# solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, arr: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        tmin, tmax, res = arr[0][0], arr[0][-1], -10**4*2
        for i in arr[1:]:
            res = max(res, max(tmax - i[0], i[-1] - tmin))
            tmax = max(tmax, i[-1])
            tmin = min(tmin, i[0])
        return res
```
linear scan approach. keep track of the min and max of the previous array. Also keep track of the max distance.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
